## üñ•Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Streamlit**: For running the web application.
- **Matplotlib**: For generating visualizations.
- **Pandas**: For data handling and manipulation.
- **OpenAI API Key**: Required for generating AI-based financial advice.

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/personalized-budgeting-assistant.git
   cd personalized-budgeting-assistant
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up OpenAI API Key**:
   Export your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-openai-api-key'
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   Start the Streamlit app by executing:
   ```bash
   streamlit run frontEnd/app.py
   ```
 

Note that for fastapi, we have hardcoded port 8000, which is also the port form which streamlit is being ran. So if you want to try multiple runs of the app, ensure to check for the process id and kill the process being ran on port 8000 before retrying.
To find the process id:  run lsof -i :8000
To kill the process: run kill -9 <processID>
