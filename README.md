## üñ•Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Streamlit**: For running the web application.
- **FastAPI**: For running the backend API.
- **Matplotlib**: For generating visualizations.
- **Pandas**: For data handling and manipulation.
- **OpenAI API Key**: Required for generating AI-based financial advice. Register for an Open AI account and get a key and save in your env variable as described below
- **Quandl API Key**: Required for pulling financial and economic data. Register for a Quandl account and get an api key and save in your env variable as described below

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/personalized-budgeting-assistant.git
   cd personalized-budgeting-assistant
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up API Keys**:
   Export your API keys as environment variables:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-openai-api-key'
   export QUANDL_API_KEY='your-quandl-api-key'
   ```

### Running the Application

#### Start the Backend Server

1. **Navigate to the Backend Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd backEnd
   ```

2. **Run the FastAPI server**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
   ```

#### Start the Frontend

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd frontEnd
   ```

2. **Run the Streamlit app**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

### Important Notes

- **Port Conflicts**: Note that both the FastAPI backend and Streamlit frontend default to using port 8000. To avoid conflicts:
  - Run FastAPI on a different port (e.g., 8001) by changing the `uvicorn` command:
    ```bash
    uvicorn api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 --reload
    ```
  - Update the frontend `app.py` to use the correct backend URL if you change the port.

- **Multiple Runs**: If you want to run multiple instances, ensure that the ports are not conflicting. Use the following commands to manage ports:
  - Find the process using a port:
    ```bash
    lsof -i :8000
    ```
  - Kill the process using the port:
    ```bash
    kill -9 <processID>
    ```
